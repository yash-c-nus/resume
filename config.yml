          subtitle: "I'm an MSc student in **Sustainable and Green Finance** at **NUS Business School.** I am also a Graduate Student Researcher at the **Sustainable and Green Finance Institute (SGFIN)**, where I contribute to developing sustainability frameworks."

          <br><br>
          My mom, a former teacher, has an extraordinary talent for breaking down complex ideas into simple, digestible terms, which makes her the best teacher Iâ€™ve ever had. This skill of **simplifying complexity** is the same approach I aspire to bring to the world of Sustainability to solve complex problems.
          
          <br><br>
          Actively seeking **Capstone Project** opportunities for **early 2025**, with a focus on applying expertise in Sustainability and Finance to solve complex, real-world challenges. "
