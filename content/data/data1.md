## Coffee in Singapore

I have been to the following spots since I came to SG in August 2024:

1. [Cafe Ren](https://www.instagram.com/caferen.sg/): The first place I went to after landing on the island. The hot mocha paired with their warm croissant made me forget about my tiring red-eye flight. The mocha is really chocolatey (which I love). I'd definitely go back.

4. [Acoustics Coffee Bar](https://www.instagram.com/acousticscoffeebar/)
5. [Kurasu Singapore](https://www.instagram.com/kurasusg/)
