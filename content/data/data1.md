## Bean there, sipped there

I have been to the following spots since I came to SG in August 2024:

1. [Cafe Ren](https://www.instagram.com/caferen.sg/): The first place I went to after landing in SG. The hot chocolatey mocha paired with their warm and flakey croissant made me forget about my tiring red-eye flight. I'll definitely go back!
2. [Puzzle Coffee](https://www.instagram.com/thepuzzlecoffee/): 
3. [Tomoro Coffee](https://www.instagram.com/tomorocoffee.sg/): Started by a fellow NUS BIZ alumni, the Tomoro @ NUS location serves fantastic coffee and pastries to college students. The oat milk latte is perfect for sipping while spending countless hours in the HSS library.
4. [Acoustics Coffee Bar](https://www.instagram.com/acousticscoffeebar/): This is hands-down my favorite place to study and relax. The Acoustics Cloud is a signature drink with a delightful cloud foam on top! It's creamy and perfectly sweet for me. I also tried the Dark Cloud, but imo, the Acoustics Cloud is definitely better.

7. [Apartment](https://www.instagram.com/apartmentcoffee/):
