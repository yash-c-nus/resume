##### I’m passionate about exploring side projects and participating in competitions. This page highlights some of my ongoing projects and showcases the competitions I’ve been involved in.

## 1. Costco Financial Modeling:
Currently, I am learning the business model of Costco. It is a membership-only big-box warehouse club retail store operator based primarily in the North America. What makes Costco fascinating is the complexity involved in its operations — especially when it comes to forecasting, given the many unique variables at play.

## 2. Visa Financial Inclusion Designathon 2024"
I had the opportunity to participate in the Visa Financial Inclusion Designathon, which was part of Singapore Design Week 2024. The event challenged us to tackle the critical question: **"How might we help Singapore's young and ageing population to participate in, and contribute to, the economy?"*

Working alongside a few friends in a diverse team of innovators and problem-solvers, we focused on creating solutions to enhance financial inclusion across the elderly aged 60 and above. This immersive experience allowed us to explore the intersection of design, technology, and finance while tackling one of Singapore's most pressing socio-economic challenges.

Here is our *white-paper* and the *presentation*.
