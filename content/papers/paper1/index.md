##### I’m passionate about exploring side projects and participating in competitions. This page highlights some of my ongoing projects and showcases the competitions I’ve been involved in.

# 1. Costco Financial Modeling:
Currently, I am learning the business model of Costco. It is a membership-only big-box warehouse club retail store operator based primarily in the North America. What makes Costco fascinating is the complexity involved in its operations — especially when it comes to forecasting, given the many unique variables at play.

# 2. Visa Financial Inclusion Designathon 2024"
I had the opportunity to participate in the Visa Financial Inclusion Designathon, which was part of Singapore Design Week 2024. The event challenged us to tackle the critical question: "How might we help Singapore's young and ageing population to participate in, and contribute to, the economy?"

Through this immersive experience, I collaborated with a few friends and our diverse team of innovators and problem-solvers, worked to create solutions that promote financial inclusion across all generations. It was an exciting platform to explore the intersection of design, technology, and finance while addressing one of Singapore’s most pressing socio-economic issues.

Here is our white-paper and the presentation.
